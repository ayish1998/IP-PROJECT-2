MAIN PROJECT OVERVIEW
*************************************************************************************
Integrated Project 2 M2I324185 TRI C 2022-23 ALU – CW1 Specification Document 
 
Introduction 
Students will work in groups and will undertake the following tasks over one trimester: 
Analysis, design, implementation, test, and evaluation of a web application that accesses a range of online data sources and delivers visualizations for the data sources (or specific subsets of the data sources). 
Students are free to select any data sources and visualisations apart from data/visualisations that have already been used within other taught modules. 
 
 ******************************************************************************************************
Overview 
 Groups will create a web application that demonstrates how to visualise data through appropriate coding practices. The project will involve finding sources of interesting data related to jobs worldwide including two dissimilar sources are required and then selecting and applying suitable visualisations to represent the data. The data should be sourced live via APIs, rather than being previously downloaded. Students should not pick examples that already exist where the data-access and visualisation are already delivered within a sample application. We are looking for students to apply appropriate visualisations to data that they have sourced, to deliver insights from the data.  
 
As well as containing the implementation of the technologies, the web application should also deliver three tutorial pages that explain the techniques utilised within the project. 
 
The application should contain an ‘authors’ page. 
 
The application should be hosted on a suitable platform (such as GitHub Pages or any other familiar web hosting). 
 
 
Deliverables 
The following deliverables are required: 
A group Report and the web application (70% of total assessment). Approximately 3000 words but in practise this will probably be more than this; there will also be diagrams, code-listings etc. 
Individual student reflective report (20% of total assessment). Approximately 1500 words 
Recorded Live Presentation 10 minutes as the maximum (10% of total assessment) 
 
 Details 
 The web application will comprise a set of web pages and a menu to allow the user to access these pages. The styling and layout of the web application is to be defined by the student groups.  
 
The application must have the following pages: 
An overview page that explains the purpose of the application. It might show examples of what is contained in other parts of the application. It can include a link to a version of the project specification document in a suitable web-readable format (such as PDF). 
An author page that provides a brief introduction to each of the group members (including technical interests) and a list of tasks undertaken within the project. Include photos if you like (not obligatory). 
Three pages that deliver visualisations based on online data sources. It is expected that these will be engaging, informative and perhaps interactive (so not just pie-carts, etc!) 
Three matching pages that explain where to source the utilised data, describe aspects of data content and structure, API-access and explain how to execute the code for the visualisation techniques. 
Another page of your choice that utilises a web-technology feature that you have not previously implemented.
